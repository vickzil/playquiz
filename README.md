While exercising my JavaScript skills, I decided to built a Quiz App. This project was tough, I had to do a lot of debugging, and research. The quiz is grouped into categories such science, current affairs, football and animal questions. its pure vanilla JavaScript (although I added a little jQuery to make it more easier). 

It is designed to kill the boredom by answering few simple questions. 

The tools I used in this project are; 
1. HTML & CSS, 
2. Vanilla JavaScript 
3. Material CSS 

I am currently working on it to add more features. You can clone this project and add to your project. Please visit https://vickzil.github.io/playquiz to view this quiz app.
